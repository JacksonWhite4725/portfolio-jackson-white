# Jackson White Portfolio
Portfolio of myself and my projects

This project was built for the second homework assignment at the DU Coding Bootcamp, but will likely be used professionally after significant updating.

To avoid plagarism, it is important to acknlowedge that quite a bit of the styling was meant to imitate the example file we recieved from DU, therefore there is some overlap in the CSS elements, particularly in the Work and Contact Me sections. Feel free to reach out if there are any problems resulting from this.
